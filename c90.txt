I am creating this app to help people with their text-to-speech needs. This app can be used for many different reasons such as helping the blind, recording a new voicemail
or pranking your friends. By using this app blind people can turn the texts from their phones into words that they can listen to. Getting this app will help you so much in 
your day-to-day life you will never understand how you lived without it.
